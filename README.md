># **Week One**

So far have learnt a lot more about git, things I should already know but hey you cant remember everything at once, unless you have have a photographic memery 
* how to go back in folders
* running npm 
* touch to create files in VSC

I now have a GitHub account guessing I need to pay so my repositories are private. I have also started taking notes on Google Doc the plan is to do this each week finger crossed I will keep on top of it. 

Work load atm is sweet in saying that I havnt started week two work yet but week one was allgood just a couple issues which you helped me fix wasnt really sure why that happened still and how you fixed it. 

**Quick questions:** are you meant to be able to drag the box? and you say you need to link the folders index.html and main.css how do you do that? :cold_sweat: and another why isnt the emoji working?
