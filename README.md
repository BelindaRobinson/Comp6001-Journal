># **Week One**

First off I picked Electron as we will learn javascript es6 which will come in handy for 3rd year papers, also Electron is quite new 2013 and with it being development by Git and Git Brash being a highly looked for skill when finding at job, I'm hoping Electron will become the same or many it already is. 

So far have learnt a lot more about git, things I should already know but hey you cant remember everything at once, unless you have have a photographic memery 
* how to go back in folders
* running npm 
* touch to create files in VSC

I now have a GitHub account guessing I need to pay so my repositories are private. I have also started taking notes on Google Doc the plan is to do this each week finger crossed I will keep on top of it. 

Work load atm is sweet in saying that I havnt started week two work yet but week one was allgood just a couple issues which you helped me fix wasnt really sure why that happened still and how you fixed it. 

Also I really like what you can do with .md, think its will be my new note system.

**Quick questions:** are you meant to be able to drag the box? and you say you need to link the folders index.html and main.css how do you do that? :cold_sweat: and another why isnt the emoji working? turns out they just dont work on the VSC preview page


# **Week Two**

This week I have realised a silly little mistake I had made, in my quick questions area (which are more for myself to work out it helps me remember better) anyway the mistake was the linking between the between the html and css pages which I have fixed and now the drag options work of course :cold_sweat: 

I am enjoying the Javascript side and its now well so far anyways making more and more sense as we go along. No more questions as of if, I prefer to work things out the best I can first as thats how I learn the best. No point just telling me as I wonth remember!


# **Week Three**

This Week was unable to get week 3 work going even though I believe from talking with you the code was completely right gotta love it aye. regaurdless of the code not running I can still see and somewhat understand what is going on and how everything is working with the information from the website. 

**Quick questions:** Warning was $ undefined really not sure why? code is correct


# **Week Four**

This weeks code is running without any errors or warnings however nothing is displaying.
